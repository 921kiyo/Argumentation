## Who gets which appointment according to the grounded extension?

(free6(a),[free6(a)]) ? ;
(free8(a),[free8(a)]) ? ;
(free6(b),[free6(b)]) ? ;
(free8(b),[free8(b)]) ? ;
(sports(b),[sports(b)]) ? ;
(child(a),[child(a)]) ? ;
(overweight(b),[overweight(b)]) ? ;
(not_get6(a),[not_get6(a)]) ? ;
(not_get8(a),[not_get8(a)]) ? ;
(not_get6(b),[not_get6(b)]) ? ;
(not_get8(b),[not_get8(b)]) ? ;

Since get6 is undecided for both a and b, none of them gets an appointment according to the grounded extensions.

## Who would get which appointment if you had used the stable extensions semantics?

sports(b),
child(a)
overweight(b)
not_get6(a)
not_get8(a)
not_get6(b)
not_get8(b)
not_sports(b)
not_free(b)
free6(a)
not_free8(a)
free8(b)
get6(a)
get8(b)

a would get an appointment at 6, and b would get an appointment at 8 according to the stable extensions
